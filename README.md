# Sentiment-Analysis
perform some sentiment analysis on Twitter US Airline dataset that I obtained from Kaggle.
I will start with loading the dataset then explore it after that I will do the necessary cleaning steps for my data. 
Then, I will move to my main task to derive and estimate the sentiment associated with individual tweets.
